# File Copy Tool

## Description
The File Copy Tool is a Python program with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library. It simplifies the process of copying a specified source file to multiple target folders within a main directory. The tool automatically removes surrounding double quotes from user input paths and provides feedback on the copying process.

## Features
- Source File Selection: Enter the path to the source file you wish to copy.
- Main Folder Selection: Specify the main folder containing the target subfolders.
- Automated Quotation Handling: The tool automatically removes surrounding double quotes from user input paths.
- Copy Operation: Click the "Start Copying" button to initiate the copying process.
- Result Feedback: The tool provides feedback on the success or failure of each copying operation, displaying the target path for each successful copy.

## Usage
1. Enter the path to the source file you wish to copy.
2. Specify the main folder containing the target subfolders.
3. Click the "Start Copying" button to begin the copying process.
4. The tool will provide status updates for each copying operation.

## Note
The program's GUI allows for a user-friendly and efficient approach to file copying, making it particularly useful when dealing with multiple subdirectories.
